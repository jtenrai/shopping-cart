making a shopping car with items, clickable descriptions and a function that sum totals the amounts at the end.
Will need:
Create objects in an array
html layout with original item divs 6
need <a> for pictures
for loop inner descriptions that can be hidden with this.queryselectorall
Prices will need to be their own div (will need to be made inline with item description through css)
css the shit out of this shopping car after.
